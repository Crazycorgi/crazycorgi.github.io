## About
I started out on w3schools coding tiny things and learning basic html.
I then found a website named https://codepen.io and started using that.
I made a website with links to some stuff my friend and I made.
I then decided to make a clock. That clock was the biggest project I had done and I loved it!

My favorite language out of HTML, CSS, and JS is **CSS**!

Well thats it! I am not that great at coding but I enjoy it and am learning!

Have a good day!
